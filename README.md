# Atharva

The intent is to develop a social media app, 
that will provide a single powerful platform to network with professionals from your field
and also indulge in personal social media where you can connect with friends and family. 
This platform will also allow you to jot down thoughts and ideas on which you can collaborate with peers.
Keep up to date on new emerging trends in your field, by subscribing to various blogs or pin the blogs you come across to your dashboard on Atharva.
Atharva will soon be your way of life on social media.
